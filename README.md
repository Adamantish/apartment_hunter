# Scrapes immoscout 24 to get there first

Immoscout lets you setup saved searches and they'll alert you about new items. But for the diamonds you probably won't receive it fast enough to get first-mover advantage. This should help.

I threw this together in a scrappy way for myself and a few colleagues. See if you can customise it to your needs.
